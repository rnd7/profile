# About
Welcome fellow. Take a seat and enjoy my presentation. A lot of spare time work is part of it. When it compiles and feels a kind of robust it is likely that it ends up here. Time is rare and there is so much stuff to do, so I will presumably not accept any Feature-Requests. Feel free to send me Pull-Requests, but please be patient.

# CV
Since I got my first Computer in 1992 I am passionate about digital creation. I gathered a variety of different skills at different levels. I produced music, designed and illustrated print and screen media, filmed and produced videos, modeled and animated in all Dimensions and finally wrote uncountable Lines of code. I started to work as professional Screen and UI Designer way back in 2005 after I canceled my physics studies.

Because I already had some coding experience and due to the increasing demand for Web Developers during the Web 2.0 hype, it did not take long to shift my focus. Until 2012 I worked as employee and freelancer in various projects for different well known companies and end customers. After 7 years of intense work I felt exhausted and decided to take a break for the next 7 years. During this period I learned, I handcrafted, I lived without anything except what fitted in my backpack. I even tried to get along without any money. Particularly this last point is really hard to achieve in our capital driven world. Consequently after just a bit more then two years I considered to work part time as software developer again, while still keeping the balance living remote on my "Wagenplatz".

Today I am in my late thirties, settled again in Hamburg and work for a tech company based in Kiel. When I joined some years ago we were a small startup focussed on projection mapping solutions. Today we are a company specialized in Video Software and Hardware, Cloud Services and the necessary infrastructure. We established an easy to use, remote controlled, offline capable, IoT Media Playback system for artists and PoS marketing experts that is used throughout different industries. Beside of this, I am still addicted to digital art. Some of my more programmatic projects you will find in my repos.

# Tech Stack
Since more then 25 years, I see technology emerging and vanishing again. I think I probably wrote code, or at least tried, in almost all mayor languages for many different purposes. Since some years, as this term became popular, I would describe myself as full stack developer, perhaps slightly UI/UX/VFX centric.

I love web technology, today especially the HTML5, preprocessed CSS3, transpiled ES6, WebGL, virtualized Linux, Node.js, Mongo kind of setup, even though I am not too opinionated. In more recent years I also had fun writing C that runs on micro controllers and embedded systems, C++ primarily for the use with the QT Framework, Java that runs on Android Devices, Python for server side scripting, GLSL to implement some fancy Shaders and beside what I forgot Golang to extend the functionality of some existing webservices. Furthermore I am quite familiar with tools like git, Jira, a bunch of IDEs, several Groupwares, the mayor Cloud Services, popular CM and DAM Systems, the Adobe stuff and the corresponding Open Source replacements, as well as Blender, Unity and the Unreal Development Kit.

# Selected work
In late 2018 I decided to dedicate some of my private software projects to the public and uploaded those. I uploaded preferably stuff that runs in your browser but some Apps need to be installed. Sometimes a bit dusty but perhaps still worth a look.
