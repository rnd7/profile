# About
My life has had many miraculous twists and turns. Today I am a father of two lovely daughters, living a model family life in the countryside just beyond the city gates. I work as consultant, project manager and software developer for Intuity Media Labs. I used to be a rebel, musician, physicist, designer, workaholic, dropout, hippie, activist, artist and philosopher.

As a skeptical person, I ask myself why individuals are usually so convinced of themselves and their model of reality. The facts are quite simple, a single person is lovable at best, but only together and over time we came up with all the wonderful achievements surrounding us today. The more ideas are exchanged, the faster innovation progresses. I believe we are all essentially just explorers, not inventors. Publishing source code and providing free Software is a contribution to this interhuman spirit of innovation.

# Audio
I've been making electronic music since the 90s, I learnt to code, why not try to develop my own musical instruments? I wrote a number of Flash synthesizers and sequencers during the 2000's. Subsequently, there were a few excursions into the world of open source audio libraries, frameworks and tools. Sometimes really annoying. Listed here some of my more recent web audio experiments.

## AWSM MKII
The second Version of the *AwesomeWaveSplineMachine*. Modular software synthesizer that utilizes dynamic WaveSpline synthesis.

## rndmsc
More or less random music. This was my first attempt to make music with nothing but JavaScript. Back then, I wrote a whole series of similar programms all based on the same pattern. This is the only demo that has survived.

## ctrl
Generic user interface component designed to interact with synthesizers or other realtime applications. I used these to fiddle around with the parameters of different otherwise hard-coded audio installations.

# Video
Together with the beloved mother of my children Aimee Slickers, I realized various different Video Installations, primarily using the pseudonym Lux & Lucid. All the tools listed here emerged from these projects and are purpose build. Most of them were only intended to perform one specific task for one occasion. Even if designed as disposable software, some were reused several times. Here is a list of the browser based tools.

## Lux & Lucid solaire
2+1 Channel Video Mixer

# Web applications


## Sana Emiolechi
Custom made image gallery that can be hosted freely on github. I don't have insta. So I created this to share images of a personal photo project with people I know.

Update: Today I have Instagram, but still don't like it.

## Weather Board
You can collaborate in real time on writing slowly fading poems using this tool. You might also use it for anonymous chat purposes and even script it to write weird messages repeatedly. In urgent cases you can roll your own server in just ten seconds. An art project in terms of its objective.

## Molehill
Molehill is a Webcrawler for repetitive data mining and dataset unification purposes. I needed something like this for a data mining task, I had a bit of time, so I wrote it.
